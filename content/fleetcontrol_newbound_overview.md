## The NewBound

The NewBound was one of the first initiatives of the World Council Assembly after its inception. The NewBound was a first-class generation ship bound for the system Jarynt. Pre-FTL travel represented the primary roadblock to the colonisation of other systems. Thus, the WCA was resigned to creating a generation ship that could sustain 7 generations.

## Arguments

### Opponents of the NewBound

> This is an absolutely absurd proposal. Not only is the engineering feat to be undertaken unprecedented, having to be more reliable than anything yet made, more resilient than anything yet made, travelling at 0.0098c - faster than anything yet made; We can't even be certain that there is a real destination to be had within Jarynt. One orbital body at a convenient distance for water, is all I see for this proposal, and that is simply not enough.

> I understand the wonderlust of an adventure such as this, and it is our duty to the future to explore and colonise new worlds. But to do so in a reckless manner such as this is a disservice to our and the future community. I expect this to be discarded, and a new proposal put in place for an explorative mission using automaton. Once completed our decedents may discuss the feasibility of this proposal.

### Support for the NewBound

> The science is robust, the expertise of our teams verified. To deny such a proposal is to discount the reliability, the certainty of our progress. At some point a leap into the void is required, ADN this proposal is the most sensible way to do it. The NewBound is not some brainchild of a naive and optimistic individual, it backed by rigorous analysis, deep investigation. This proposal will not only ensure the safety of its passengers but provide a quality of life parallel to that of home. The research into the destination as been validated and repeated over many generations already. The planet Lientsil is habit ital for us.

### Verdict

The proposal was accepted with an amendment. That the NewBound upon arrival would be able to sustain itself indefinitely in the Jarynt System, if the conditions on Lientsil were less than favourable. The generation ship was built in vacuum over the course of 5 decades, designed in a modular way with redundant systems allowing for up to a two-thirds of the ship to be malfunction before a total system failure.
