# World Cooperative Assembly

## Overview

The World Cooperative Assembly (WCA) is the international institution where nations meet to deliberate on and resolve global issues, such as issues pertaining to the environment, trade, territorial disputes, provision of aid, technological and biological hazards, and international infrastructure such as the network of jetports, transport subtunnels, infonet and energy transmission.  The WCA has nineteen partner-states who participate in deliberations, and four observer states.

The WCA is the body that facilitates and achieves global order, security and peace, while ensuring that partner-states retain full autonomy.  Without a cooperative institution such as the WCA, global challenges and international disputes can threaten to lead to environmental or military disaster, placing people in poverty and disadvantage, or even rendering all or much of the world uninhabitable.  Only voluntary cooperative bodies such as the WCA can ensure global prosperity.

## Extra-Global Jurisdiction

The WCA is also the body that oversees extra-global issues such as orbital infrastructure rules, extra-planetary resource management and transport coordination.  For these purposes the WCA has developed the World Research Council, the System Resource Management Council, the Orbital Governance Council and Fleet Control, sub-bodies that handle off-world issues as they arise.  Each of these bodies is afforded generous autonomy but are created under the directives of and answerable to the WCA.  Together, these institutions identify and resolve issues on behalf of the WCA.

## Global thinking

The WCA and its child organisations have been developed to overcome national pressures and engage in truly global thinking.  Delegates to the Assembly are elected from institutional positions within each country rather than appointed by heads of state, ensuring that they are focused not on the priorities of the government of the day, but on issues and goals that affect citizens around the globe.  The WCA focuses on the long-term outcomes for all people of all nations.

## Project Outwatch

The World Cooperative Assembly, on R286.3.14, voted to direct the World Research Council to draw up plans for extra-solar exploration, with a focus on inhabitable planets, economic opportunities, significant research priorities, and the identification of possible life.  From this directive, the World Research Council developed [Project Outwatch](wrc_projectoutwatch_overview.md), a cooperative effort to explore beyond our planet and bring the benefits of resources and knowledge back for the entire world.
