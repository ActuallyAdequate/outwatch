# Non-Local Relay Network

## Overview

The non-local relay network (NoLoRN) is a system-based communications network that allows for virtually instantaneous communications between networked spacecraft and institutions within the orbit of Somnis.  It consists of 67 relay beacons occupying Lagrange points within the inner system.  It is used by [Fleet Control](fleetcontrol_overview) to coordinate the movement of system-based craft, by local governors to report information to their home nations, and by devolved autonomous companies to relay highly critical commercial information.  The NoLoRN Board, operated by Fleet Control, allocates network space and sells any surplus network capacity to other bidders, such as individuals for personal communications.

The non-local relay network uses dark-energy decay filaments to communicate at superluminal speeds, allowing time-critical fleet coordination information to prevent unnecessary fuel usage.

## Structure and Operation

The NoLoRN consists of 67 relay beacons which each have a set channel capacity to communicate to other beacons.  Most beacons are located in Lagrange points to allow for robust and predictable communication targeting.  Each beacon has a set number of channels to communicate with specific beacons, because dark-energy decay filaments do not easily allow for general broadcasting.  Each channel is therefore monitored closely and updated to engage with new filaments when necessary, as the beacons change relative positions.  Because the beacons have a fixed capacity, each channel is configured at different times of the day to access the required incoming traffic (coinciding with the morning/evening cycles of different system timezones).

## Controlling Board

The NoLoRN Board is appointed by Fleet Control and oversees both the general operation of the network as well as the market for the network.  The board prioritises all Fleet Control operations, and need to scale back channel capacity as required when large-scale fleet operations occur.  The Board is also in charge of denying access to the network when end-users are non-compliant with either NoLoRN policy or Fleet Control orders.

## Communications Market

There is generally spare capacity on the network, and when this occurs the Board sells the surplus network capacity to commercial interests and individuals.  As capacity changes throughout the "day", prices scale, resulting in a real-time market bidding process.  The proceeds go towards maintenance of the network, to the proposed expansion of the network, and to Fleet Control running costs.
