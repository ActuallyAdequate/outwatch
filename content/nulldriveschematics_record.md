# ∅-Drive Schematics

## Explanation

The ∅-Drive ("null drive") is the application of negative mass for the use in vacuum borne vessels. The drive allows for two distinct functions when used for space flight.

The ∅-Drive enables propulsion via the use of the effect of gravitational waves creating a repulsive force on negative mass, allowing for launch systems planet-side, and the ability to use planetary and stellar objects as a source for propulsion in vacuum based mobility.

In addition to the propulsive forces provided by the ∅-Drive, it also allows for the mass of the vacuum-borne craft to be offset by the negative mass of the drive. This results in a net-zero mass allowing the light barrier to be surpassed.

## Schematics

The ∅-Drive is composed of a high density material such that the negative mass is greater in magnitude than the positive mass of the spacecraft. The amount of repulsive force is determined by encapsulating some part of the negative matter in a negative spatial field to control the acceleration with regard to net-mass of the entire system (both spacecraft and drive). By balancing the magnitudes of the negative and positive mass the system can have a net-zero mass. No force is enacted on the craft, thus via other propulsive measures the craft can exceed light speed.
