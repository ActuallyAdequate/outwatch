This documentation outlines the potential applications and feasibility for the use of negative density systems in application for propulsion.

## Negative Density

The negative density system proved by the researcher Dr. T Hildert presents exciting applications for passive energy propulsion technologies.

## Applications

### Launch Propulsion

The negative mass, exhibits repulsion to the forces of gravity, which lend it to be an effective method for launching craft from on planet. Anything within the negative spatial field experiences a negative mass effect, resulting in objects within the field to rise with regard to the force of gravity. Disappointingly this effects only persists within the field, and as such would require a negative spatial field, in a column configuration, which would create a space elevator allowing platforms to rise within the field. The fields can be reactive to drop the platform back to planet-side.

In order to implement such a device a negative space field must be maintained at a scale thus far unprecedented. Additionally, the significant energy demands, make this option a non-starter.

### Sublight Propulsion

This method of travel is deemed ineffectual with the current state of negative spatial fields and the negative mass equivalent entities (nm-e) they contain. This is primarily due to the effects of the negative density systems only exhibiting behaviours within the fields, and thus can not function on external objects such as a space vessel.

With true negative mass objects that exhibit appropriate behaviours in normal (positive) space, a highly efficient low energy drive could be constructed for sublight navigation. Using the gravitational waves within a star system, the drive could repel from the gravitational waves with negative mass, and attract to opposite gravitational forces with positive mass. This push-pull effect would allow for near light-speed travel at a calculated 0.97c travel speed.

### Small Field Stabiliser

Negative spatial fields do have a feasible application in stabilisers for use on multi-terrain vehicles. The small fields size would still allow for normal mass to 'rest' upon nm-e suspended in the negative spatial field. These negative density systems could allow for improvements made to vehicular travel. However, to be financially viable to implement, energy efficiencies need to considerably increase, whether it is through decreased consumption in the maintenance of the negative density system, or increase in the production of energy in the vehicle's power core.

## Verdict

The current state of negative density systems make it unsuitable for propulsion systems. The technology requires significant efficiency, and system maturity to be viable as a space vessel drive. Currently, the largest negative space system created was of a 3.43 metres in size, consuming 20 Megawatts of power. The negative mass behaviours are only exhibited within the negative density system, and thus all propulsion must be contained within the space. With this severe limit, critical and fundamental changes are required to make this a viable technology.
