# Recovery of the WCA-FC NewBound

The [NewBound](fleetcontrol_newbound_overview.md) generation ship was on it 5th generation cycle when the advent of the [∅-Drive](wrc_nulldrive_overview.md) changed space travel entirely. Conflict between and within the WCA and WRC about whether to notify the NewBound of this discovery, resulting in a compromise that the Passengers and crew of the NewBound would not be told until both the technology had matured enough to allow for a recovery mission and an onsite investigation[^1] of the Planet Jarynt had been conducted to ascertain whether the inhabitants could colonise the planet.

## No Longer The First

Concerns were raised regarding the impact that disclosing that the passengers of the NewBound would no longer be the first to set foot on in a new system and brave the unknown, would result in a ship-societal breakdown. Psychologist Fernaday Remarks:
> We must be delicate. The society of the NewBound will have undergone significant drift from our own society, we must approach it in a cautious way. The people of the NewBound have shared a singular goal over 5 generations. To break that goal is to break the psyche of every individual on board.

## The Finishing of the Journey

Ultimately the NewBound were not told about the development of the ∅-Drive. The ship had reached near the end of its 6th generation by the time that ∅-Drive had matured enough and a full exploratory mission regarding the Habitability of Lientsil and a safety assessment of the planned landing site was conducted[^2].

## Info Quarantine Breach

An Information Quarantine was set up to prevent unverified communications to the NewBound. The direct channel to the NewBound was controlled by the information team at fleet control. However, what was not considered was that the NewBound had implemented a new set of sensor arrays to monitor phenomena along there travel. An incident had occurred where the NewBound detected emissions from Expedition 4's vacuum vessel. A report was received approximately 5 years later for the WRC by the NewBound[^3].
