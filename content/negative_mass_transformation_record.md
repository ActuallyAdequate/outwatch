## Abstract

This research paper presents the construction of negative mass equivalent entities (nm-e), utilising spatial field manipulation, to alter density of space-occupying objects. This paper's solution proposes a non-material transformative approach to create nm-e rather than obtaining form exotic materials.

## Negative Mass

The development of the equations of reality those of Newton's force equations, and Einstein's Field equations have underpinned study of reality, to the complete annihilation of the initial researcher's to reduction of name only. These equations have proposed the speculation of an exotic matter that exhibits behaviour in an opposite direction to that of regular (positive) matter. This so-named negative matter inspired many speculative applications, such as those for propulsion, wormhole creation, or space manipulation.

### Behaviours of Negative Mass

A brief outline of the behaviours of negative quickly self justify the research stature. Negative Mass acts in the opposite direction to how usual positive mass. When a force is applied to a massive object, that object will experience acceleration in the same direction as the force. However, the same force applied to an object with negative mass will experience acceleration in the opposite direction. An exciting example which speaks to an opportune application is that of the force of gravity, enacted on a negative mass object, would cause the object to rise. This paper is unconcerned with the applications of negative mass, rather presents the feasibility for synthesising it.

### Negative Matter and Anti-Matter Disambiguation

These two matter's a not the same, anti-matter in actuality is quite similar to matter, merely its opposite in charge. Anti-matter particles are also involved in spontaneous annihilation in which two particles on matter the other anti-matter will annihilate each other emitting energy. Negative matter is derived entirely theoretically from the previously stated reality equations. Unlike negative matter, anti-matter empirically exists.

### Failed Attempts at procuring Negative Matter

One would hope that acquiring negative matter would be as straight forward as acquiring antimatter. The attempts at the harvesting of exotic material to acquire negative matter have all lead to inevitable lack of funding due to non-results. Alternative methods present the creation of matter through energy, this is a phenomenon that has been observed and thus more promising results await. The independent researchers at MatTech successful constructed a variety of particles from energy. Unfortunately, no amount of manipulation of (positive) energy could create negative mass. While successful in procuring funding based on the applications of the materials they had made, they ultimately failed at their goal.

## Spatial Fields

The research in this paper has successfully led to the procurement of Negative Mass. This was achieved through the manipulation of spatial fields rather than the manipulation of the mass itself. While the mass is not negative with and of itself, the entire enclosed system is a negative mass equivalent entity (nm-e), displaying all the expected behaviours of negative mass.

## Theoretical Basis

The density equation is a simple equation. The density of a space is equivalent to the mass of the particles in that space, over the entire size of the space. Similar to the reality equations of Newton and Einstein, the density formula too, works perfectly fine with negative values. Hence rather than introducing a negative mass (which would have negative density), we instead allow the mass to exist in a negative space. This also results in a negative density.

## Creating Negative Space

The creation of negative space is no trivial matter, however with sufficient energy, small negative space fields can be made up to a few microns in width. (Width being a misnomer considering the space itself is changed). Unlike with the utilisation of (positive) energy which can only create (positive) mass, it is possible to create (negative) space with (positive) energy. In order to do this, we expand space fields with energy in repetitive-tri-fold pattern, which creates an interference pattern allowing for the resultant negative space field at the intersection, due to the compression of each expanding space field.

## Negative Density

Under Lab environment the negative density object successfully exhibited known behaviours of negative mass objects. The mass itself when exiting or entering the negative spatial field, technically remain normal matter, however its presence in the negative space results in a negative density. This creates an object with equivalent behaviours to a (true) negative mass object.
