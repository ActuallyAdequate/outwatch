# Dark-Energy Decay Filaments

## Overview

Dark-energy decay filaments are spacetime artefacts resulting from out-of-phase spacetime expansion events driven by dark energy.  Dark energy fields produce spacetime expansion but disruptive events - even those from the creation and annihilation of virtual particles - can bring these field expansions out of phase. When two dark-energy fields become out of phase, they produce Oerten shears where edge-points of a single field are motivated along an angle in imaginary space.  When the expansionary field slows, the connection between two adjacent edgepoints becomes non-local, with a two-dimensional vector of imaginary space between them, known as a "filament", called by Oerten "the stretch-marks of the universe".  The ends of filaments function as virtual wormholes.

Researchers predict that any patch of "empty space" contains millions of such filaments, and that they are more common near stellar bodies than between them.

## Application

Dark-energy decay filaments allow a particle to traverse a great length in an almost instantaneous amount of time, and thus allow for near-instant communication.  Filaments are nanoscopic and only allow for the passage of elemetary particles such as leptons, gauge bosons and quarks.  

Non-local relays exploit these filaments to send near-instant messages to distant locations, but the identification of accessible filaments can be problematic.  Typically a message will be broadcast over a "bandwidth" of identified filaments to create a high-probability chance that the filament will reach the destination point.  All filaments exhibit signal loss and noise over long imaginary distances (that is, the more "stretched" a filament is, the higher the probability at each internal point that the signal will decay), so non-local communication is currently limited to intra-system communication, as well as ship-to-shore communication between exploratory craft and crew.
