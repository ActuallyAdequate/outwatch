## Overview

The Bivron system[^1], centred on the star Artors I, was discovered in R233 and features a relatively cold M-class star, several planets, a dust-belt, a significant centaur, and is lcoated in a larger dust-ice cloud featuring millions of ice-based planetisemals called the Lanarch Deep.

Many of the bodies with the system feature frozen gases and liquids, including two planets which are largely covered in in ice: the inner planet Vongout, whic exhibits a thick layer of liquid water on the sun-side and a frozen layer of water on the dark-side, and Waken, which is mostly covered in frozen liquids (including a high percentage of frozen water), with a thin band of liquid water present at the equator.
