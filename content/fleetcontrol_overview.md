# Fleet Control

## Missions

### Early Missions

Early inter-system missions mostly involved the launching of unmanned craft to provide remote investigation. The most significant of these early missions was the generation ship [NewBound](fleetcontrol_newbound_overview.md), a huge undertaking to establish a colony on a remote world prior to the invention of faster-than-light technologies[^1].

## Ship Design

### Terminal Black Boxes

Black boxes were fitted to every vacuum vessel under fleet controls mandate. These black boxes maintained constant connection to a node in the NoLoRN network ensuring that the vessels could be tracked in the event of an incident. The black boxes primarily serving as a communication node also record all ship system data. The highly redundant systems also establish ad hoc connections and signal hijacking, thus allowing the crew to attempt to communicate to other black boxes or leave and retrieve black box signals. This means that if one black box becomes irretrievable, it is possible all the data and the terminal instance of that black box was recorded by another black box in the region.
