# Fleet Control

## Missions

### Early Missions

Early inter-system missions mostly involved the launching of unmanned craft to provide remote investigation. The most significant of these early missions was the generation ship [NewBound](fleetcontrol_newbound_overview.md), a huge undertaking to establish a colony on a remote world prior to the invention of faster-than-light technologies[^1].

[1]: Faster than light travel became possible with [Null Drive for Inter-system Transit](intersystemtransit_record.md), while faster than light communication became possible with the [NoLoRN](wrc_nonlocalrelay_overview)
