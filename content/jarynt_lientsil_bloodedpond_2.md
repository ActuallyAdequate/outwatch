The soil is not so foreign, the dampness I am familiar with, the gritty feeling on the soles of my feet, a nostalgia of running through the fields of Tokientsia. Sitting here, eyes closed, I feel not so far away beloved. The presence of vibrancy felt in the living, to be connected despite such alienation. I hear your whisper, the breeze carrying your comfort.

I am here, in a place alien, opening my eyes it's apparent, these are not the bushels of Paritsula, nor the waters of Tokiensye. The chirps and burbles, while familiar with their existence, are foreign in their tune. The shifting of octaves, the incidental notes, they are a parody that makes me uneasy. My Sula, I gaze into a pond wishing for a window to you. The dance of the fish, their flourishing frills, there three-finned dance, they weave a complement of body to body. They swirl and spin with such elegance, a dance I am denied with you.

The parity to home does not extend the vastness of vacuum. These fish with colours of deep red, evoke an inner murder within the calm waters. To lay my hand in the cool pond would be to mingle my blood with theirs. Water with crystalline fibres, is reminder of the perverse ways that the alien can end the unwary so shortly.
