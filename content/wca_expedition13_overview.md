# Expedition 13 Overview

Expedition 13 was a joint participant WCA mission tasked with recovering an artefact that was found by Expedition 4 on Lientsil in the Jarynt System. Expedition's 4 final message delivered by the non-local relay network, was request to investigate an item of interest. Three local days later no further voluntary communications were received aside from the scheduled system notification delivered by the vacuum vessel.

Expedition 13's primary goal was to rendezvous with Expedition 4 and aide in the recovery of the item of interest. The fourteen members of Expedition 13 were fitted with mandatory reporting black-boxes to prevent repeat of the failure of voluntary communication from Expedition 4. Expedition 13's black boxes create a direct NoLoRN connection routed through the vacuum vessel's redundant communications array.
