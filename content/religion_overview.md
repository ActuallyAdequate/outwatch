### Religions

## Overview

The WCA aims for global cooperation and recommends an understanding of the sensitivities of a variety of cultures, religions and languages from around the world.  This is especially important given the intense proximity that crewmembers of WCA offworld projects share.  In an effort to ensure peaceable cooperation both in policy design and sensitivity and accommodation of crew, the WCA provides recognition and education for a variety of significant religions.
