## Background

The development of negative mass equivalent entities, were an exciting prospect, allowing access to a variety of technologies based upon negative mass. Disappointingly the negative spatial fields do not truly create negative mass materials, as they must exist within the negative spatial field. Thus, uses are limited to what can be implemented within the constraints of the field. The field size has conclusively met its limit at 29.43 metre diameter spherical field. This, as of current models, is a hard maximum, known as the Inhreed constant. This falls dramatically short of what is required for practical use cases in spacecraft, and the proposed negative density system space elevator.

## Proposal

The size of the negative density system is granted that entire laboratories can be placed within the negative spatial field allowing for comprehensive studies to take place. This has lead to the methodology proposed in this paper to produce true negative massed matter.

Through the use of inducing the creation of matter anti-matter particle pairs, it has been deemed possible to create true negative mass matter. By passing energy through a vacuum chamber within the negative spatial field the energy can be consumed to create matter and anti-matter pairs, these quickly annihilate each other unless separated.

What has been observed is energy involved in this process will always create particle pairs native to the space they occupy, such that the density is always positive. This means that the particles created within the negative spatial field will have a positive density, which entails that the matter has true negative mass, when removed from the negative spatial field.

It seems that the state of mass (positive or negative) isn't dependent on the state of energy (positive or negative) as previously thought. Instead, energy of any kind will reliably produce matter that is native to the spatial field it occupies. Hence, by separating the negative massed matter-antimatter pairs, and allowing the anti-matter to be annihilated by a positive massed matter donor, we can successfully produce a surplus of negative massed matter.

## Transience

The production of negative mass opens up the opportunity for highly efficient propulsion systems, opening up the potential for inter-system travel. The effects of the negative mass in a positive mass system create interesting effects, such that if the two masses are connected, they cancel out, effectively creating zero mass systems. Furthermore, by implementing a negative spatial field, the negative massed matter can be passed through the field to modulate exact forces within the entire system, allowing for degrees of mobility within the gravity fields.
