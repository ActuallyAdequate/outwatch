# Reunificationism

## Overview

Runificationism, also known as the Returning Embrace, is a religious belief that focuses on the origins and teleology of consciousness, proposing a single, early-universe origin for phenomenal consciousness that dispersed through the expansion of the universe.

Reunificationism is largely associated with the nation of Por-Guwlen, becoming the national religion and being the central point of pilgramage.
