# Waken Report

![_|Waken|80](waken_planet.png)

## Overview

Waken is the seventh and outmost planet of the Bivron system, layered in nitrogen-ice at the poles, water-ice neared the equator, and with a thin band of liquid water at the equator.  Because of the stability of the liquid water, kept in liquid form by a combination of sunlight and geothermal vents from an active core, Waken was chosen as a primary site to review for potential life.

The mission was carried out by the Por-Guwlen vessel _Latent Quarry_, and was generally considered a success.  The expedition collected 331 ice-core samples with potential indicators of bacterial and algae-like life.  Despite the success, and plans for future expeditions to the same co-ordinates, further missions were indefinitely delayed.
